Web app that takes real-time images using Open CV and verifies them to be of the same person marked as ‘Anchor’ in the dataset (Collected in real time by Open CV). It copies the model from the paper: Siamese Neural Networks for One-shot Image Recognition using a custom Distance layer to calculate the difference between two streams of images
